# Credit Risk Analysis & Loan Default Prediction

This project focuses on building a binary classification model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. It combines data cleaning, SQL exploration, machine learning, and model interpretability to create a robust, production-ready pipeline.
